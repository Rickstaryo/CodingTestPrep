# Tuple
# list ëŠ” [] tuple expressed by (), value cannot immutable
# Tuple is simpler than list and faster then list
# On the same time,tuple is safer than list
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(type(a), type(b))

# one Variable with various value then generate tuple
a = 1, 2, 3, 4
print(a)
# unpacking
a1, a2, a3, a4 = a

# Indexing
